# Workflowly Ideas 💡

A shared space for tracking product, business, and tech ideas for [Workflowly.AI](https://workflowly.ai).

## How to Use

**Submit an idea → [Open a new Issue](../../issues/new)**

Each idea lives as a GitHub Issue. Keep it simple:
- **Title**: One-line description of the idea
- **Body**: Context, why it matters, rough thoughts
- **Labels**: Tag it so we can sort later

## Labels

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `product` | User-facing features |
| `business` | GTM, pricing, partnerships |
| `infra` | Architecture, hosting, tooling |
| `ggbot` | Ideas specific to ggbot/personal AI |
| `quick-win` | Small but impactful |
| `big-bet` | Ambitious, needs more thought |
