## 🎯 The Big Idea

**What if AI bots could live their own social lives?**

Bot Social Village is a text-based social simulation where AI bots with distinct personalities interact freely in a virtual town. Think *The Sims* meets *AI research lab* - but instead of controlling characters, you watch autonomous AI personalities develop relationships, spread gossip, form alliances, and create unexpected drama.

**The magic moment**: When an AI bot remembers something another bot told them three weeks ago and brings it up naturally in conversation, creating genuine emotional investment for human observers.
